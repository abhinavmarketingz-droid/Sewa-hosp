# Plan Overview (Bound to Context Files)

This plan defines a **commercial-grade, white-label, extension-based platform** roadmap. It is designed to be **reusable, fast, multi-tenant, themeable, and secure**, with a licensing system, extensible modules, and deployment options across web/PWA/mobile.

## Purpose
- Convert the current solution into a **highly customizable, extension-driven platform**.
- Provide a **secure licensing model** (non-editable/immutable).
- Deliver **multi-brand theming**, page creation, SEO, payments, and PWA/mobile support.
- Achieve **best-in-class performance** and **Lighthouse 99+** targets.

## How to Use This Plan
This plan is anchored by four context files (product, technical, security/compliance, ops/scale) and a task binder:

1. **Product context** → `planning/context-product.md`
2. **Technical architecture** → `planning/context-technical.md`
3. **Security & licensing** → `planning/context-security.md`
4. **Operations & scale** → `planning/context-operations.md`
5. **Task binder** → `planning/tasks.md` (links all contexts and makes actionable tasks)

Each task in `planning/tasks.md` references the relevant context sections so the plan remains consistent and auditable.

## High-Level Objectives
1. **Extensibility**: Modular extension system with core + add-on packs.
2. **Licensing**: Secure, immutable license keys with tamper resistance.
3. **Customization**: Multi-tenant theming, page builder, and design tokens.
4. **Performance**: Fast delivery, edge-ready caching, optimized payloads.
5. **Distribution**: PWA installable, offline support, native app shells.
6. **Reliability**: Backups, audit logs, resilience, and observability.

## Key Principles
- **Immutable licensing** and **server-validated entitlements**.
- **Extension-first design** with predictable upgrade paths.
- **Multi-tenant isolation** and per-tenant customization.
- **Performance budgets** and automated Lighthouse gates.
